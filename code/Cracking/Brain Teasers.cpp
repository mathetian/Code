1. Cook an egg: 15 minutes
Each rope: 60 minutes

Method: fire one rope two sides. At the same time, fire another rope. When the first rope has finished.
Fire the other side of another rope.

2. 3 1 3 6 = 8
Solve, 8 = 4*2, 2+4,16/2  => ((3+1)/3)*6 = 8

3. 8*8, cut two. Whether 31*2 can fill the board?
Surely no, prove it? Just guess. Use black and white theory.

4. Two jugs, 3 and 5. To get 4 => Can get 2 & 3 => put 2 into 3L and put another 1 into 3L. Remain is 4L.
